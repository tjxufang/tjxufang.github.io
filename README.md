# Hello! Welcome to the repo of my website
#### Version 1
The project was created to be my personal webpage and for those who want to know a bit more about me.

Link to my website: https://tjxufang.github.io

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Notable Third-party Packages Used in Project
#### 1. axios: for sending requests to email.js
#### 2. gh-pages: for deployment to GitHub Pages
#### 3. notistack: for top notification banner
#### 4. prop-types: for type checks of each component
#### 5. react-transition-group: for transition animation between pages
#### 6. typewriter-effect: for a typing effect in some components
#### 7. sass: all UI designs (except for notification banner) are made using vanilla SCSS
#### 8. eslint: for coding conventions

## Available Scripts to Run The Project
In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`
Installs all dependencies before `npm start` to run this project properly.

### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
